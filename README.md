# CS50 Final Project
This repository hosts my final project for the Harvard / edX CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course. The project involves the development of a full-stack AI web application that allows students to practice their basic conversational skills in a foreign language. The web app features a chatbot that can understand the intent of the studentâ€™s dialog and respond accordingly thanks to the use of natural language processing, deep learning and cloud-based AI services. Students interact with the chatbot via a front end developed in HTML, CSS and JavaScript with Python as the server-side language, TensorFlow for deep learning and a SQL database to manage user and session data on the back end. 

As of March 2022, the project is in the final stages of development. A full set of instructions for running the application is forthcoming.
